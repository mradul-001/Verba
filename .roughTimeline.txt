Week 1: Introduction and Fundamentals

    Day 1-2: Introduction to Speech-to-Text Technology
        - Overview of the project and its objectives.
        - Discuss basic concepts: audio processing, features (MFCC), and speech recognition.

    Day 3-4: Data Collection and Preprocessing
        - Guide students on how to collect and preprocess audio data.
        - Implement MFCC feature extraction.
        - Discuss the importance of data quality and diversity.

    Day 5: Environment Setup
        - Ensure all students have the necessary libraries and tools installed (e.g., TensorFlow, librosa).
        - Set up version control (e.g., Git) for collaborative work.

Week 2: Model Architecture and Training

    Day 6-7: Model Design
        - Introduce CNN and RNN concepts.
        - Walk through the architecture design for CNN-RNN-CTC.

    Day 8-9: Implementation
        - Assist students in implementing the model in code.
        - Discuss loss functions, specifically CTC loss, and why itâ€™s used.

    Day 10: Training the Model
        - Guide students through the training process.
        - Discuss strategies for optimizing hyperparameters and monitoring training progress.

Week 3: Testing and Validation

    Day 11-12: Model Evaluation
        - Introduce evaluation metrics like WER (Word Error Rate).
        - Implement evaluation functions to assess model performance.

    Day 13-14: Error Analysis
        - Analyze errors from the model predictions.
        - Discuss potential reasons for errors and areas for improvement.

    Day 15: Iterate and Improve
        - Work on refining the model based on evaluation feedback.
        - Encourage students to experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters.

Week 4: Finalization and Presentation

    Day 16-17: Final Testing and Documentation
        - Conduct final tests on the model with diverse inputs.
        - Prepare documentation detailing the project setup, code explanations, and usage instructions.

    Day 18-19: Project Presentation Preparation
        - Guide students on how to present their project, emphasizing key findings, challenges, and learning outcomes.

    Day 20: Final Presentation
        - Have students present their project outcomes to the group.
        - Provide constructive feedback and celebrate their achievements.

Optional Activities:
    Weekly Check-ins: Short meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and provide guidance.
    Resource Sharing: Encourage students to share useful articles, papers, or tutorials related to speech recognition throughout the timeline.
